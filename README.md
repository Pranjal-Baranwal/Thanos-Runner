# Thanos-Runner
This is a T Rex game type of thing, where obstacles are like red objects and instead of T Rex, we have a thanos running.
You control a Thanos-shaped character that automatically runs forward.
Obstacles spawn randomly, and you must press SPACE to make Thanos jump over them.
As you keep jumping and scoring:

After 15 jumps → Power Mode activates (speed and obstacle size increase).

After 125 score → Final Form activates (even faster!).

The game ends if Thanos collides with any obstacle.

Features:-

Built completely with Tkinter (no extra libraries required)

Smooth jump mechanics with gravity

Random obstacle spawning

Power-up stages (Power Mode + Final Form)

Score display on screen

Simple collision detection

Requirements

Python 3.x

Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python on most systems)
